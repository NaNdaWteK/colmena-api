# La colmena

The behive is an open source project with the aim of creating a partnership of bee workers collaborating for a common goal.
The main purpose is to take advantage of the resources of our workforce to facilitate access to some services to those who have less. It is a collaborative process in which people can offer what they can collaborate and receive what they need and that the beehive can offer.

The management of time and the rules that are imposed are open to the participation of colaborators or future users. All kinds of suggestions are accepted
